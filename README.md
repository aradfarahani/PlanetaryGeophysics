## Interactive 3D Mars Globe Visualization

This project features an interactive 3D globe of Mars showing topography and seismic events (Marsquakes). The visualization is created using Plotly and can be embedded in HTML.

### How to view the interactive globe

Open the included `mars_globe.html` file in a modern web browser to explore the 3D Mars globe with seismic data.

### Embedding the visualization in markdown or Jupyter notebooks

To embed the interactive Plotly visualization in markdown or Jupyter notebooks, you can use the following HTML snippet:
