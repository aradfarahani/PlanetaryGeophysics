# PlanetaryGeophysics

**PlanetaryGeophysics** is an open-source project dedicated to analyzing and visualizing geophysical data from planetary bodies across the solar system. It provides tools for processing seismic events, topographic mapping, and interactive 3D visualizations to support research into planetary interiors, tectonics, and seismic activity beyond Earth.

## 🌍 Interactive 3D Mars Globe Visualization

This project includes an interactive 3D globe of Mars that visualizes MOLA topography data and seismic events detected by NASA's InSight mission.
